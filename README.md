# CheatSheet
A Reference Page for Grid-related Attributes and Values


I made this cheat sheet as part of a Codecademy project in Front-end Web Development.
The task was to make a simple personal reference page that meets the following requirements:

		- Project should use the <table> element for the main structure of the website.
		- Project should deal with at least one HTML or CSS related topic.
		- Any code related text should make use of a Monospace font.
		- Project should have a unique color scheme.
  
  
This projects was straight forward and I attempted to use some css that was new to me as well.
One problem I faced was styling individual rows or columns within the table. I resorted to adding classes to the needed elements in order to apply for example the monospace font. There is probably more effective and less time consuming way to do this, but I was unable to find such. Comments welcome.
